# MECHANICHS
React `NTH DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS` together to create new ones. Any `NTH DIMENSION OBJECTS` with the same `SPECIAL` will react together. Any `NTH DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS` with the same `DIMENSION`, regardless of `SPECIAL`, will degrade once reacted and make you lose. `SELECT` elements with left click to move `NTH DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS` to a new `REACTION CHAMBER` before elements are reacted.
